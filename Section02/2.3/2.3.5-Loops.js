// Follow the steps below to create a **while** loop that TOTALS the numbers from 1 to 100

// 1) create a variable to represent the current number
let x = 2
// 2) create a variable to represent the current total

let total = 100
// 3) write a while loop that sums the numbers from 1 to 100
while (x <= 30) {
  console.log(x);
  x += 10;
  x++;
}


// Now using the same variables you created in steps 1 and 2, create a **for** loops that TOTALS the numbers from 1 to 100
